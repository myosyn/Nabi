# Nabi 나비
Nabi is a stability driven Discord bot that strives for modern features as well as being completely free. There is absolutely no catch when it comes to this. Yes, all of 
the features are completely free, and come straight from the creator's pockets. We want to prove that JVM languages are the future for Discord bots. 

The main libraries that we used are the [Kord Library](https://github.com/kordlib/kord) and the extension [Kord Extension](https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/kord-extensions)
