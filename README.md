# Nabi

A modular, stable bot that was made for the purpose of multipurpose execution, as well as possessing the feature for 
using both ephemeral and public slash commands. 

Built using the Kord and Kord-Extension Library, this guarantees your server more protection and more versatility. 

## Why Nabi?
Nabi was made to fill in the void between choosing between public and ephemeral slash commands. It was also made as a 
phishing bot, so you don't have to deal with those pesky robots telling you that there is a free nitro promotion. 

## Is there an ETA for updates?
No. Currently, there is one active developer, and one semi-active developer. However, we believe that this is a 
community maintained bot, so updates will scale based off of that.
