# Nabi 나비
Nabi is a stability driven Discord bot that strives for modern features as well as being completely free. There is absolutely no catch when it comes to this. Yes, all of 
the features are completely free, and come straight from the creator's pockets. We want to prove that JVM languages are the future for Discord bots.

The main purpose of this bot is to provide modern moderation, phishing detection, and other features that will be introduced later down the line. We could possibly make
it a music bot as well, but no.

The main libraries that we used are the [Kord Library](https://github.com/kordlib/kord) and the extension [Kord Extension](https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/kord-extensions) .

**We're currently getting ready to rewrite Nabi, but we're still using the same Kord library, but we're using Discord Interaktion over the Kord Extension library.**
