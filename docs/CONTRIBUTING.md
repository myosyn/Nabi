Nabi will remain a community driven bot for the foreseeable future, being completely free for usage, as
well as most parts remaining open source for the foreseeable future. However, some parts are required
to stay closed source, most likely because of the fact that people can abuse said features, and make
work arounds for that feature. Therefore, we cannot risk letting those features out in the wild.

Since Nabi is a community maintained bot, we are very restrictive of the stuff that gets through and
the things that don't. We really only want quality features that aren't useless, and if they prove to
be useless, then we will have it removed, or we'll close the pull request outright.

Again, this is not to shame you. We just want a highly community driven bot that has the most modern features,
but at the same time, we also have to appear professional when doing this.

# How to contribute
If you want to contribute, please note that you need to format your pull request to be formal, as well
as concise. We don't want to hear your life story, or hear you say `AMONG US SUSSY` in the pull request.

You must state:
* What you're adding to the bot
* What it does
* Why we should add it

Based on this, we will ask the two owners (@euphorxa & @vispin) for their opinions. If they accept,
the pull request will be merged into the repository. If not, it will be closed, and the feature won't
be merged into the repository. 

Also, if there are any issues that have the label `Feature` on it, these pull requests have higher priority
over the rest, primarily because we absolutely need these features completed as soon as possible to help the 
development of the bot.

The main reason behind this system is to find out who would be a large help with the development of Nabi,
primarily due to the fact that we don't want a situation of *Monkeys and typewriters*, so any help to 
development of the bot is highly appreciated. 

# Notes
Please do not make the same pull request over and over again. This wastes resources that could otherwise be
used to implement other features.

Certain commands also shouldn't be removed. These include all of the test commands, as well as the developer
command. If you are contributing, do not remove those commands. It is crucial in order to check if the bot will function or not.
