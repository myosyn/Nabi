# Discord
This houses all of the nessecary information about Nabi, where each directory holds different purposes. This works by funneling all of the directories to spam
the source, where the core of the bot is. It will then compile into one bloated jar for you to successfully quit your job.

## Directories
* [Commands](https://github.com/myosyn/Nabi/tree/dev/discord/commands/src/main/kotlin/dev/myosyn/nabi) - Houses all of the crucial commands for Nabi to function.
* [Database](https://github.com/myosyn/Nabi/tree/dev/discord/common) - Houses all of the things we use to isolate one server's configs to their respective server.
* [Common](https://github.com/myosyn/Nabi/tree/dev/discord/database) - Houses all of the stuff that was too stupid to be inside commands, idk why though.
* [Phishing](https://github.com/myosyn/Nabi/tree/dev/discord/phishing) - Houses all of the phishing APIs we have in place to get rid of people like those.

## Note
This branch is **EXPERIMENTAL**. Things will break, and in many cases, and we know that it will.
