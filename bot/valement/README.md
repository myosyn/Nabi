# Valement

A REST-only Kord Framework designed to interopt with existing Kord code.

## Why?

For one, Kord Frameworks are very lackluster in terms of maneuverability. Here are some of my issues with some of these
libs:

- Discord Interaktions
  I actually like this library so I don't know why I am putting this here. Unfortunately, it was recently deprecated due
  to
  the developers finding several issues with Kord.

- Kord-Extensions
  Kord Extensions is simply bloated with unnecessary features that would otherwise be provided by other libraries. For
  example,
  most developers wouldn't need translations, which would otherwise be included in the extra modules directory. However,
  that
  is my opinion, and people have different opinions. Also, the code simply looks very ugly when you include several
  builders.

- Kfox
  The repository is private. I don't think I can do much about it to be honest.

- DiscordKt
  I've never really gotten into the specifics of DiscordKt, so I can't really say much from experience.

For this reason, it's been a priority to make a reliable Kord Framework that can be expandable and also interopt with
existing
code that you've already created.
