# Valement

A forked version of Discord InteraKTions that we use inside of this bot.

## Why?

I have no clue. I could've forked the project, which is what I originally was going to do, but I'm having some issues
with
uploading it to my maven repository, so that is always fun.

Also they archived it so now I have to update the dependencies.
