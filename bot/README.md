# Discord

**NOTE:** In the near future, we hope to deprecate the main bot (In the source root folder), as KordEx currently doesn't
suffice our needs. We will plan to switch over to using our in-bot framework, called valement. This will make the bot
more
modular and self-sufficient rather than relying on Kord-Ex.

## Directories

``discord``
The directory of which we keep our Discord bot in.

``valement``
A REST-only framework for Kord that is based on pain and misery.
